DOM (Document Object Model)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interpretation for HTML documents. It facilitates the representation and access of the parts of a page in order to modify its structure, style, and content. The DOM views the web page as a group of structured and ordered nodes, which have properties and methods, making it much easier to access the parts for programming or styling (it is also closely related to JavaScript).

CSS:

It's a language that works in conjunction with HTML, designed to define the visual aspects of elements (tags), such as color, size, appearance, etc. Essentially, it compensates for the design limitations and complexity of HTML.

Implementation Methods:

- Linked: Included in .css files within the file's head section

- Embedded: Using the `<style></style>` tag

- Inline: Defined within the tag using the style property. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!

- Basic concepts
  
Attributes: These are the modifiers that can be added to each style (a style can be composed of one or more attributes)

First examples: tag redefinition
