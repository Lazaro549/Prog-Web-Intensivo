# Class 31 - Modifying Information, JScript assisted by jQuery
## 🐱‍👤 Jquery: Conceptos básicos de uso
- Event-driven programming

- Modular

- DOM-based (document structure)

- Browser-abstracted

- <script></script> inclusion

- .js files

- Can be combined with other frameworks (Bootstrap 4.x, for example)

- Library call:

`$(<element>).<event/function>`

where:

`$` = jQuery

`()` = selection space

`<element>` = selection within the document (via #id, .classes, or combinations of attributes)

`.` = code appending

`<event/function>` = executable for the selected element

- Code Block

In JScript, it's not possible to write linear code, so it's grouped into blocks. A block or function can be named or anonymous (example below), with the latter being more common.
```
function(){
}
```

In JavaScript, the entire process happens on the client side, so browsers come with built-in debugging and development tools.

In Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + i (or right-click and select Inspect)
