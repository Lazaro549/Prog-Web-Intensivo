# Class 28 - Menu bar and functional improvements
We created a reusable code segment (menu.php) which provides all the actions available to the user of our app, including logging out.
We developed the session control: creating **exit.php** and improving the action in **login.php**, which can now detect inactive users and record the login date and time.
We started working on displaying error messages to users, for which we worked in index.php, using the server variable **$_GET["op"]** and the Bootstrap component **Alert**.

Work: desarrollar todos los Alert para cada error o mensaje.
