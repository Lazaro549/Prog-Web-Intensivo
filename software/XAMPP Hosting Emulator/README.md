# XAMPP Hosting Emulator

To test our websites and applications, we will need to have this tool installed on our computer.

The software itself "simulates" web hosting for our projects. It is free and open-source; several versions are available, but I've attached the one we will use in class.

For previous versions of Windows and 32-bit systems, install:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/7.3.2/xampp-win32-7.3.2-0-VC15-installer.exe/download

Note:
I've added the link to the address we'll need to use to test our exercises.

http://localhost
