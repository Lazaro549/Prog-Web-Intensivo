# VS Code File Editor
To work on this course, any text editor is sufficient; however, there are powerful and free tools that can make our task easier.

I've attached the link to the software we'll be using in the course (Visual Studio Code). It might be a good idea to add some extensions to help us create our apps.

I recommend installing the following extensions:
- Spanish Language Pack for Visual Studio Code (translates the editor)
- PHP Extension Pack (Tools for PHP)
- HTML5 extension pack (Tools for HTML5)
