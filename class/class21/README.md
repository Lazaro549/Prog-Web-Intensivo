# Class 21 - Bootstrap: The Grid

**Grid**

To model pages with Bootstrap, we'll use the grid, which is a series of product components that allow us to lay out the content and modify its appearance according to the visitor's screen size (responsive). The grid is composed of a container that acts as the "perimeter" or limits of the view or page. Within the container, we can use rows that arrange the content vertically (one above the other), and finally, within the rows, we have columns that provide horizontal spacing and adjust as the screen size changes. (An example of a responsive grid is attached.) The concepts of scale and spacing apply to columns; scale refers to the behavior depending on the screen size, and spacing refers to the proportional volume within the view (always a maximum of 12).

The grid can change according to breakpoints or scales (display screen size), which in version 4 are:

- **sm** = small displays

- **md** = medium displays

- **lg** = large displays

- **xl** = large, high-resolution displays
